# Atrium - Status

> Snapshot of what genuinely works and what is left, as of 2026-06-14.
> Atrium is in early development; nothing here is a release promise.

## Scope note

Atrium is a **controller** app. Video playback was removed by design
(2026-06-12): media servers are browse/manage only. Do not re-add a player.

## What is DONE (genuinely complete)

- Core foundation: profiles, multi-instance, dual-URL routing, secure key
  storage, import/export (live-verified incl. SAF picker), per-service
  health dots, theming, launcher icon
- **qBittorrent** (phone-verified live): cookie login (qBit 5.x 204 fix),
  3s realtime list polling, add magnet/file, categories, pause/resume/
  delete/recheck/queue moves, detail screen (overview/files/trackers),
  per-file priority
- **Sonarr** (live-verified, the deepest module): poster grid, series detail
  (seasons, monitor toggles, season search, delete), search-and-add (quality
  profile + root folder + monitor options), queue 3s / library 60s polling,
  interactive release search, plus Wanted (missing + cutoff-unmet), History,
  Blocklist, System (status/disk/tasks/health/backups), and a Settings editor
  (indexers, download clients, notifications, import lists, host/media-
  management/naming config) - settings writes live-verified
- **Radarr** (live-verified): same depth as Sonarr, movie flavored, plus
  interactive release search
- **Calendar** (top-level tab, replaces the old Library placeholder): month
  grid aggregating upcoming Sonarr + Radarr airings/releases with status dots
- **Prowlarr** (live-verified incl. grab-to-client): indexer list + stats
  w/ 60s polling, enable/disable (forceSave), test, manual search across
  indexers w/ seeders/size/age sort, grab lands in the download client
- **Tautulli** (live-verified incl. a real stream): Activity tab w/ 10s
  polling, session detail sheet (codecs, decisions, bandwidth, terminate
  w/ inline errors), History, Stats (30-day home stats), Users
- **Glances** (system monitor, contributed): per-instance polling, animated
  CPU/Memory gauges, swap + per-core usage bars, network rx/tx, disk usage,
  uptime (built and renders; not yet live-verified against a real Glances
  server)

## Partially done

### Media servers - Jellyfin / Emby (browse + detail + search)

Have: auth, library chips + poster grid, folder drill-down, Continue
Watching resume rows, item detail screens, in-server search, favorite
toggles (contributed). Missing:

1. Next Up / Recently Added home rows
2. Now Playing / active sessions tab
3. Watched/unwatched toggles

### Plex (browse + hub + detail + search, live-verified)

Have: library chips, a Home hub (Continue Watching from on-deck +
Recently Added), poster grid, folder drill-down, item detail (synopsis,
genres, cast with headshots/roles, ratings, runtime), global search, and a
watched/unwatched toggle (scrobble) on the detail screen and card
long-press. Missing:

1. Now Playing / active sessions tab (deliberately skipped - the Tautulli
   module already shows live Plex sessions)
2. Show-level detail (a show still drills straight to its seasons grid)

### Other shallow modules

- Bazarr: only badges + wanted list; missing search/download subtitle
  actions, history, per-item language profiles
- Overseerr: request list + approve/decline only; missing titles/posters
  (needs tmdbId lookup), discover/search, issue reporting
- SABnzbd: queue control only; missing history, categories, speed limits,
  polling

## App-wide TODO

1. Release signing + F-Droid metadata (debug-signed right now)
2. iOS platform scaffold
3. Live-stack testing of Bazarr/Overseerr/SABnzbd (built from docs only)
4. Possible profile loss after Android hard-kill (seen once - investigate
   crash-safe Hive writes/backup)
5. Polish: empty states, tablet layouts, localization
