/// A named collection of [Instance]s.
///
/// Most users will have exactly one profile ("Default"), but the abstraction
/// is useful for two cases:
///
/// 1. A user who manages multiple stacks (e.g., "Home" and "Friend's
///    place") and wants a single tap to switch the whole set of instances.
/// 2. Sharing - a profile can be exported as JSON (with secrets optionally
///    stripped) and imported by another user.
///
/// The active profile is tracked separately by the profile package; this
/// model is just the shape on disk.
